c			     Error Codes
c
c  All error messages are of 1 or more lines.  They begin with three
c  asterixes (***) followed by a token and end with a period
c  followed by a dash (.-).  If an input file keyword appears in the
c  message, it should be surrounded by double quotes.
c
c  When an error is caught, it should set an error code.  The codes are
c    0   no error (and no message)
c    1   informational (tokens: Caution  Position  Ending)
c    2   warning (token: Warning)
c    3   error (token: Error)
c
c  Informational messages are those that do not indicate a problem,
c    but do indicate something the user should know about.  Currently
c    used informational messages are for debugging messages,
c    positional messages, impending early termination of the program,
c    and non-serious cautions.
c  Warnings are for things that should not impede the progress of the
c    program, but which may produce output that is not what the user
c    intended.  Warnings include unknown keywords and exceeded parameters.
c  Errors are things the preclude the continuation of the program.
