c           with nofx and polyft by explicitly carrying around misc.f file,
c           information for fluorescence normalization,  move atoms list 
c           parsing to external subroutine to allow expanded atoms list, 
c           rmax card to 5 digits + 0.00001, fixed potential numerical 
c           problem in metric (2/96) made groups module (3/96) angles in  
c           monoclinic settings, 
c    2.4?.b rework makefile using uninclude perl script and unzipped
c           modules, added xanes card 
c    2.4?.c added keywords "feff8" and "correction", added optional
c           feff8 output (BR Jan 16 1998)
c
c    to do: new crystal, fix monoclinic angles
c
c    2.50   change structure of source tree, use libraries and include 
c           files in a more sensible manner, (BR Mar  2 1998) (goals
c           for 2.50pre1: modularize crystl+groups+clustr, remove logic()
c
c    changes in functionality from versions before 2.50
c    1. no longer support more than one job per file
c    2. consistent message syntax for post-processing purposes
c
c    goals for 2.50pre2: clean up remaining code, allow spcgrp=ispa,
c                        end keyord wade through code cleaning up
c                        run-time messages
c    goals for 2.50pre3: begin work on monoclinic
c    other goals for 2.50: revise document, write crystl user guide,
c       more output types, see wishlist
