AncientAtoms
============

This is the ancient, entirely unsupported, written-in-Fortran version
of Atoms

The Makefiles work on a computer running Ubuntu 13.04 using gfortran
from GCC 4.7.3.  The resulting executable has been shown to run to
completion for one test case.  It has not been tested with any other
crystal datam, on any other computer or with any other compiler.

This source code is being placed on GitHub as a courtesy.  I will
provide no support of any kind for the use of this software.  I will
provide no advice for how to compile this software.  I will fix no
bugs.  I will answer no questions.  Indeed, any questions or comments
you have on this version of the program are likely to be silently
ignored.  This is obsolete software.

I hope the preceding paragraph is clear.

The entire functionality of this program was reimplemented many years
ago and has since been integrated into my Artemis program, a part of
[Demeter](http://bruceravel.github.io/demeter/).
