<H2><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="atoms_toc.html#TOC2">Overview</A></H2>

<P>
ATOMS writes a list of atomic coordinates for any crystal given
its crystallographic information. The list will be sorted by radial
distance from an atom chosen as the central atom. ATOMS also
estimates the bulk absorption and density of the material and various
corrections to XAFS data due to experimental effects.


<P>
ATOMS runs from an input file, which uses keywords to specify the
input parameters. The code requires a file called <CODE>atoms.inp</CODE>.
Because some operating systems are case sensitive the code will search
for <CODE>ATOMS.INP</CODE> if <CODE>atoms.inp</CODE> is not found. The output is a
text file that can serve as the input file for FEFF. This file is
appropriate for versions of FEFF from 5 through 8, but not
FEFF3 or FEFF4.


<P>
<CODE>atoms.inp</CODE> must contain all the data necessary to uniquely specify
the crystal. The information that the program requires is:



<OL>
<LI>

The Hermann-Maguin or Schoenflies notation for the crystal space
group. The notation conventions are slightly modified to work with a
keyboard. This document lists all 230 groups as recognized by the
program.
<LI>

The non-redundant, non-default cell axis lengths and angles
between the axes.
<LI>

The two letter symbol and cell coordinates of each unique
atom. The definition of unique atom is an atom occupying a unique
crystallographic site. Sodium chloride (NaCl) has two unique atoms
that must be specified. In Lead Titanate (PbTiO3), for example,
there are two unique oxygen sites, so four unique atoms must be
specified. One of the atoms must be chosen as the central atom.
</OL>

<P>
Usually this data can be taken directly from the crystallography
literature. When confusion arises, consult <I>The International
Tables of X-Ray Crystallography</I>. This is the standard by which
the program was written.


<P>
Chapter 3 should be read carefully. That chapter explains all of the
conventions necessary to specify crystallographic information in
ATOMS. This is a wonderful program in that it quickly generates
a list of atomic coordinates for an arbitrarily complicated crystal.
It is an awful program in that it requires you, the user, to speak its
language. There are numerous quirks and limitations to the algorithms
that interpret unit cell structure. Much error checking is included
in the code. If ATOMS finds something in the input file that it
does not like, it should give a useful run-time message.


<P>
The output is a file that can be used to run FEFF, the <I>ab
initio</I> multiple scattering XAFS code written by Rehr and Zabinsky. The
atom positions are organized into a list in the format read by
FEFF. ATOMS makes reasonable guesses for several other inputs
to FEFF. The <CODE>feff.inp</CODE> file generated by ATOMS will run
FEFF to completion.


<P>
ATOMS has been extensively tested, but is not guaranteed to be free
of bugs. If you are displeased with the result of a run and you have
followed all of the instructions and hints in this document, then you
may have found a bug. To report your bug, first capture to a file all
screen messages from the run with the suspect input file. Send the
screen messages, the input file, and any output files to the
author. Also tell what kind of computer you are using and which Fortran
compiler you used to make the executable. You will find the author's
e-mail address on the title page of this document.




<H2><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="atoms_toc.html#TOC3">About Version 2.50</A></H2>

<P>
Version 2.50 of ATOMS is almost identical to the last version --
2.46b.  The most important change is that, by default, it writes input
files which are suitable for FEFF8.  If you want ATOMS to
write input files using the syntax of FEFF6 or FEFF7, set
<CODE>feff8=false</CODE> in the <TT>`atoms.inp'</TT> file.


<P>
There have also been a number of bug fixes and general code maintenance
incorporated into ATOMS.  A few new keywords have been added.  See
Chapter 2 for details regarding keywords.


<P>
Take particular note of the <CODE>SCF</CODE> card in the FEFF8 input file.
It's first argument determines the size of the cluster used to calculate
self-consistent atomic potentials.  See the FEFF document for
a discussion of sensible values for this number and always be sure to
edit your FEFF8 input file accordingly.  A poor choice for this
number can result either in poor potentials or in needlessly lengthy
calculations.

<H1><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="atoms_toc.html#TOC4">Keywords</A></H1>



<H2><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="atoms_toc.html#TOC5">General Format</A></H2>

<P>
Take a peek at Appendix B. Included there are many examples of input
files for ATOMS. Each one specifies lattice parameters, a
space group, positions of atoms within the unit cell, and a few other
pieces of information. The purpose of this chapter is teach you how to
construct input files, thus to communicate with ATOMS.


<P>
<CODE>atoms.inp</CODE> uses keywords to describe the inputs. With only
a few exceptions, the keywords are allowed to occur in any order in
the file, and usually have transparent meanings. This structure
allows the input file to be easily read and modified. All keywords
use the syntax:

<PRE>
   keyword delimiter value(s) delimiter ...
</PRE>

<P>
The delimiter can be:



<OL>
<LI>

one or more white spaces (blanks and/or TABs)
<LI>

one equal sign and any number of white spaces
<LI>

one comma and any number of white spaces
</OL>

<P>
Most keywords take only one value. Many keywords can be put on one
line (though some keywords require their own line). Internal comments
can be written anywhere in <CODE>atoms.inp</CODE>, which help remind
you what the keywords mean, or how you chose the input
values. Keywords can be in upper, lower, or mixed case. ATOMS
is not sensitive to the case of keywords or their values.




<H2><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="atoms_toc.html#TOC6">List of Keywords</A></H2>

<P>
Here is a summary of keywords and their meanings. The following
sections give more detailed explanations for each keyword. Where
appropriate, default values are given in brackets.

<H2><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="atoms_toc.html#TOC7">Explanations of Keywords</A></H2>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><B>* or % or ! /</B>
<DD>
Everything after one of these characters on a line in the input file
will be ignored by ATOMS.

<DT><B>Title</B>
<DD>
Indicates a user-chosen title line which will be written to
<CODE>feff.inp</CODE>.
9 title lines of 72 characters each can be used. Everything on a line
after the keyword title will be included in the title. If keywords
are on the line following title, they will be read as part of the
title, not as separate keywords. The word <CODE>comment</CODE> is synonymous with
<CODE>title</CODE>.

<DT><B>Space</B>
<DD>
This keyword is followed by the Hermann-Maguin or Schoenflies
designation for the space group. Complete lists of these designations
are are found in Appendix A. Because the Hermann-Maguin designation,
as adapted for the keyboard, includes spaces, this keyword is handled
specially by ATOMS. <CODE>space</CODE> should be on its own line or at
the end of a line.

<DT><B>A</B>
<DD>
This specifies the first lattice constant. A must always be
specified. In a cubic or rhombohedral space groups, where only one
lattice parameter is needed, A is the one to specify.

<DT><B>B</B>
<DD>
This specifies the second lattice constant. It is set equal to A
unless specified.

<DT><B>C</B>
<DD>
This specifies the third lattice constant. It is set equal to A
unless specified. In tetragonal, or hexagonal space groups, this is
the second lattice constant that must be specified.

<DT><B>Alpha</B>
<DD>
This specifies the angle between B and C. Specify the angle in
degrees. This is the angle that must be specified for rhombohedral
space groups. The default value is 90 deg.

<DT><B>Beta</B>
<DD>
This specifies the angle between C and A. Specify the angle in
degrees. The default value is 90 deg. This is the angle that must be
specified for monoclinic space groups.

<DT><B>Gamma</B>
<DD>
This specifies the angle between A and B. Specify the angle in
degrees. The default value is 90 deg for orthogonal groups and 120
deg for hexagonal and trigonal groups.

<DT><B>Core</B>
<DD>
This specifies the absorbing atom. The value of this keyword must be
a site tag. This atom will be placed at the center of the cluster and
will be used as the central atom in the McMaster and fluorescent
correction calculations. The central atom must be specified by this
keyword. This is a change from early versions of ATOMS. This
keyword has no default. A central atom must be specified. The
keyword <CODE>central</CODE> is synonymous with <CODE>core</CODE>.

<DT><B>Rmax</B>
<DD>
This specifies the maximum radial distance in the cluster of
calculated atomic coordinates.

<DT><B>Index</B>
<DD>
This is a logical flag, thus takes a value of true or false. Along
with the coordinates, the atom list in <CODE>feff.inp</CODE> contains the
symbol of each atom. With the index feature turned off, only the two
letter symbol of each atom is printed. With it turned on, atoms of
the same type will be numbered sequentially according to distance. To
enable this feature, the syntax is

<PRE>
index true
</PRE>

An example: in pure copper, the 12 nearest neighbors will be labeled
Cu01, the 6 next neighbors will be labeled Cu02, and so on. Without
indexing, all the atoms will be labeled Cu.

<DT><B>Shift</B>
<DD>
Moves all atoms in the atom list by the specified amount. This keyword
takes three real numbers as its values. The syntax is:

<PRE>
shift xvalue yvalue zvalue
</PRE>

The value of the shift vector is simply added to all fractional atomic
coordinates in the atom list. Read the section on Multiple Origins in
section 3.6 for a discussion of the usefulness of this keyword.

<DT><B>Out</B>
<DD>
This specifies an output file name other than <CODE>feff.inp</CODE>. It can
be up to 72 characters, so can include a directory path as well as the
file name. If <CODE>out = list</CODE> is specified then a file called
<CODE>atoms.lis</CODE> will be written instead of <CODE>feff.inp</CODE>.
<CODE>atoms.lis</CODE> will contain the title lines and the coordinate list
but none of headers or FEFF keywords. This option is useful for
applications other than FEFF that require a list of atomic
coordinates.

<DT><B>Edge</B>
<DD>
This specifies the absorption edge of the central atom. If edge is
not specified, the default value is determined from the Z of the
central atom. For central atoms with Z&#60;=57, the K edge is chosen.
For heavier atoms, the L3 edge is chosen. K, L1, L2, and L3 are the
only values for edge recognized by ATOMS.

<DT><B>Nitrogen</B>
<DD>
This number specifies the percentage by pressure of nitrogen gas
in the I0 chamber in a fluorescence XAFS experiment. Specifying
either this keyword or the argon or krypton keywords tells
ATOMS to estimate the corrections to the data due to the
energy response of the I0 chamber and the self-absorption of the
sample. These calculations are described in detail in chapter 4.
This keyword takes a real number between 0 and 1 as its value. The
default is that the fluorescence calculations are turned off.

<DT><B>Argon</B>
<DD>
This number specifies the percentage by pressure of argon gas in
the I0 chamber in a fluorescence XAFS experiment. Specifying either
this keyword or the nitrogen or krypton keywords tells ATOMS
to estimate the corrections to the data due to the energy response of
the I0 chamber and the self-absorption of the sample. These
calculations are described in detail in chapter 4. This keyword takes
a real number between 0 and 1 as its value. The default is that the
fluorescence calculations are turned off.

<DT><B>Krypton</B>
<DD>
This number specifies the percentage by pressure of krypton gas
in the I0 chamber in a fluorescence XAFS experiment. Specifying
either this keyword or the nitrogen or argon keywords tells
ATOMS to estimate the corrections to the data due to the
energy response of the I0 chamber and the self-absorption of the
sample. These calculations are described in detail in chapter 4.
This keyword takes a real number between 0 and 1 as its value. The
default is that the fluorescence calculations are turned off.

<DT><B>Geom</B>
<DD>
This is a logical flag, thus takes a value of true or false. If
true, ATOMS will write a file called <CODE>geom.dat</CODE> for use in the
path finder module of FEFF. If <CODE>geom.dat</CODE> is written, the
<CODE>NOGEOM</CODE> card will be written to <CODE>feff.inp</CODE>.

<DT><B>Unit</B>
<DD>
This is a logical flag, thus takes a value of true or false. If true,
ATOMS will write a file called <CODE>unit.dat</CODE> contining the atomic
coordinates of all atoms in the unit cell as well as all atoms on the
walls, edges, and corners of the unit cell.

<DT><B>P1</B>
<DD>
This is a logical flag, thus takes a value of true or false. If true,
ATOMS will write a file called <CODE>p1.inp</CODE>. This file is a valid
input file for ATOMS. It contains the entire contents of the
unit cell in the atoms list and has the space keyword set to <CODE>p 1</CODE>,
the monoclinic space group of no internal symmetries. All axes and
angles are explicitly specified in <CODE>p1.inp</CODE>, as are <CODE>core</CODE>,
<CODE>edge</CODE>, <CODE>rmax</CODE>, and all of the title lines.

<DT><B>Feff</B>
<DD>
This is a logical flag, thus takes a value of true or false. By
default it is true and will write out <CODE>feff.inp</CODE>. If it is false,
ATOMS will not calculate the cluster of atoms, thus will not
write out either <CODE>feff.inp</CODE> or <CODE>geom.dat</CODE>.

<DT><B>Dopant</B>
<DD>
This keyword specifies the type and percent substitution of a dopant
material. The syntax is:

<PRE>
   dopant dp tag percentage
</PRE>

Where <CODE>dp</CODE> is the atomic symbol of the doping atom, <CODE>tag</CODE> is
the site tag of the site where the dopant resides, and the percentage
is a real number between 0 and 1 specifying the amount of
substitution. If <CODE>tag</CODE> is an atomic symbol rather than a site tag,
then all sites containing that atomic species will affected.

<DT><B>Atom</B>
<DD>
This must be the last keyword in the input file. If it is not the
program will almost certainly stop running. This keyword tells the
program to go to the next line and begin reading in the unique atom
coordinates. The atom list is a five column, structured list. Column
one is the two letter atomic symbol (<B>not</B> the Z number). Columns
two through four contain the x, y, and z coordinates of each atom.
These numbers are entered as fractions of the a, b, and c axes
respectively. The fifth column contains the site tag. See section 2.4
for an explanation of the site tags. The keywords atom and basis are
incompatible. If both are specified in an input file, the program
will stop running.

<DT><B>Basis</B>
<DD>
This must be the last keyword in the input file. If it is not the
program will almost certainly stop running. This keyword tells the
program to go to the next line and begin reading in the basis atom
coordinates. The basis list is a five column, structured list.
Column one is the two letter atomic symbol (<B>not</B> the Z number).
Columns two through four contain the x, y, and z coordinates of each
atom. These numbers are entered as fractions of the a, b, and c axes
respectively. The fifth column contains the site tag. See section 2.4
for an explanation of the site tags. A basis may be constructed
around an empty site. Specify that site with the word <CODE>null</CODE>
rather than an atomic symbol. The keywords atom and basis are
incompatible. If both are specified in an input file, the program
will stop running.

</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="atoms_toc.html#TOC8">Specifying Site Tags and the Central Atom</A></H2>

<P>
The central atom of the cluster written to <CODE>feff.inp</CODE> must
be explicitly specified with the keyword core. To avoid ambiguity in
a situation involving inequivalent crystallographic sites containing
the same atomic species, the value of this keyword must be a site tag.
The site tags are the user supplied character strings which appear in
the fifth column of the atom or basis list.


<P>
<B>Users of Atoms 2.41 and prior versions:</B> This is the most
important difference between ATOMS 2.42 and versions numbered
2.41 and lower. Previously the fifth column of the atom or basis list
was used to specify the central atom. The addition of site tags used
to label the different sites requires specification of the central
atom by keyword.


<P>
The fifth column of the atom list contains the site tag. The user may
label the sites in any way desired and these labels may be up to 10
characters long. The sites must be labeled uniquely or else
ATOMS will become confused if one of the sites labeled
redundantly is chosen as the core atom. If a tag is not specified for
a site then the default tag will be used. The default for a site tags
is to label that site with the atomic symbol of the occupying atom.
Remember that ATOMS is insensitive to case, thus the tag
<CODE>THISATOM</CODE> is the same as <CODE>thisatom</CODE> and <CODE>ThisAtom</CODE>.


<P>
Here is an example. Note that the the value of core is a tag, not an
element symbol.



<PRE>

   O       0.5      0       0.3783   O4
</PRE>

<P>
This is the <CODE>atoms.inp</CODE> for superconducting Y Ba2 Cu3 O7. Notice
that the copper and oxygen sites are tagged with unique labels. The
central atom is specified with one of these labels -- the <CODE>Cu1</CODE>
site will be at the center of the cluster written to <CODE>feff.inp</CODE>.
The yttrium and barium sites are tagged with the atomic symbol by
default. Since each of these species occupies only one site, there is
no ambiguity in using the atomic symbol as the tag.


<P>
In <CODE>feff.inp</CODE> each atom will be identified by its tag, not by its
atomic symbol. Assignment of unique potentials, however, is based on
atomic species. If you wish to assign unique potentials based on
crystallographic considerations, you will need to edit <CODE>feff.inp</CODE>.




<H2><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="atoms_toc.html#TOC9">Basis List v. Atom List</A></H2>

<P>
ATOMS has the ability to recognize basis vectors. For some
lattice types this is a somewhat nicer way of describing the
structure. In introductory solid state physics texts, the diamond
structure is often described as face centered cubic with a two atom
basis. For example, silicon might be specified as a diamond structure
crystal with a unique atom at position (1/8, 1/8, 1/8). It might also
be specified as an FCC structure with a basis of (0,0,0) and (1/4,
1/4, 1/4).


<P>
ATOMS handles a basis list slightly differently from an atom
list. When given an atom list, the code translates each point in the
list by the symmetry operations specified in the space group name.
When given a basis list, the code only performs these symmetry
operations on one of the points listed. It then constructs the basis
at each of the points so generated. The keyword core may select any
atom in the basis as the central atom of the cluster.


<P>
The best use of this feature would be to generate an atom list for a
structure that is described by a periodic repetition of some large,
complex local structure. Clathrates are an excellent example of this.


<P>
One very important rule must be followed when using a basis list. The
first atom in the list must correctly represent the desired
translation symmetry. In the case of silicon, the basis must be
translated like the point (0,0,0) in space group <CODE>F m 3 m</CODE> (the
space group of FCC crystals) to yield the diamond structure. Thus the
first atom in the basis list for silicon <B>must</B> be at (0,0,0) or
else the basis will not be expanded correctly.


<P>
A basis can be constructed around an empty site, by specifying the
coordinates of the empty site as the first entry in the basis list and
entering the word <CODE>null</CODE> instead of an atomic symbol. The null site
will not appear in the atom list in <CODE>feff.inp</CODE>. The keyword core
may not take <CODE>null</CODE> as a value.


<P>
To finish the example of silicon, here are two input files that give
the same output:



<PRE>
title Si, fcc with a two atom basis
a = 6.485 space F m 3 m ! space group of fcc
rmax=6.5 core=si1
basis
  Si 0.0  0.0  0.0  si1
  Si 0.25 0.25 0.25 si2
-----------------------------------------

title Si, diamond structure
a = 6.485 space F d 3 m ! space group of diamond
rmax 6.5
atom
  Si 0.125 0.125 0.125
-----------------------------------------
</PRE>

<P>
See section 3.7 for an explanation of why the silicon atom in the
second example must be at (1/8, 1/8, 1/8) rather than at (0,0,0).




<H2><A NAME="SEC10" HREF="atoms_toc.html#TOC10">Dopants</A></H2>

<P>
ATOMS handles dopants in the simplest possible fashion. It
assumes all dopants are substitutional and that there are no
correlations between cells regarding which lattice sites are occupied
by doping atoms. Furthermore, ATOMS makes no assumptions about
which physical sites are occupied by dopants. Thus the atom list
written to <CODE>feff.inp</CODE> is the list for the undoped structure.
ATOMS uses information about the dopants in the following ways:



<OL>
<LI>

For calculating the density, the absorption, and the
experimental corrections.
<LI>

A dopant may be the central atom in the atom list, thus the
calculations mentioned above will be performed at the absorption edge
of the dopant.
</OL>

<P>
The syntax is:

<PRE>
  dopant dp tag percentage
</PRE>

<P>
where <CODE>dp</CODE> and <CODE>tag</CODE> are character strings and percentage is a
number between 0 and 1. The value of <CODE>dp</CODE> is the atomic symbol of
the dopant. The value of <CODE>tag</CODE> is the site tag of the site where
the dopant resides. If the value of <CODE>tag</CODE> is an atomic symbol then
all sites containing that atomic species will be doped.


<P>
ATOMS allows up to 3 dopants per site and no more than 9 in
the entire crystal. If this is insufficient, then you have a mess on
your hands. You also have my sympathy -- contact me and I will help
you alter the code to accommodate your horrid problem.


<P>
The atomic species specified for a site by the dopant keyword need not
be the minority component. This might be useful for uniquely
specifying the core atom. Vacancies may be introduced by doping
sites with <CODE>null</CODE>.


<P>
Analyzing a doped material in fine structure spectroscopies is
complicated. The simple scheme that I describe in this section is
useful for several of the calculations in the code, but is clearly
insufficient for the task of resolving the local structure of a doped
material. That ATOMS writes the atom list in <CODE>feff.inp</CODE> using
the undoped structure is indicative of this.




<H2><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="atoms_toc.html#TOC11">geom.dat</A></H2>

<P>
The path finder in FEFF has an option to use crystal symmetries
in order to speed the determination and computation of all paths.
This is done by providing a file called <CODE>geom.dat</CODE> containing
special flags specifying the relevant symmetries. Setting <CODE>geom =
true</CODE> in <CODE>atoms.inp</CODE> will tell ATOMS to write a <CODE>geom.dat</CODE>
file and to place the card <CODE>NOGEOM</CODE> in <CODE>feff.inp</CODE>. This leads
to a large reduction of computation time only in crystals of high
symmetry. In an fcc structure, the reduction in time can be as high
as a factor of about 50. In a structure of lower symmetry, the
savings will rarely be more than a factor of about 4. Use of the
geom.dat generated by ATOMS will not effect the computation time
of the potentials and phase shifts calculation of the first module of
FEFF, nor will it effect the computation time of the individual
paths in the third module. The <CODE>geom.dat</CODE> file has the same atom
list as the <CODE>feff.inp</CODE> file.


<P>
To use the <CODE>geom.dat</CODE> file, it must be located in the directory in
which FEFF is run. Since the <CODE>NOGEOM</CODE> card is in
<CODE>feff.inp</CODE>, FEFF will know to access at the appropriate time
the geom.dat file written by ATOMS. The <CODE>geom.dat</CODE> file and
the atom list in <CODE>feff.inp</CODE> should both remain unmodified, or else
FEFF might get confused. The FEFF card <CODE>RMAX</CODE> can be
changed to limit the extent of the FEFF calculation without
needing to change geom.dat. See the FEFF document for more
details about this.




<H1><A NAME="SEC12" HREF="atoms_toc.html#TOC12">Space Groups</A></H1>



<H2><A NAME="SEC13" HREF="atoms_toc.html#TOC13">Notation Conventions</A></H2>

<P>
The two most commonly used standards for the designation of three
dimensional space groups are the Hermann-Maguin and Schoenflies
conventions. ATOMS recognizes both conventions. Each of the
230 space groups as designated in each convention is listed in
appendix A.


<P>
The Hermann-Maguin system uses four symbols to uniquely specify the
group properties of each of the 230 space groups. The first symbol is
a single letter (<CODE>P, I, R, F, A, B</CODE> or <CODE>C</CODE>) which refers to the
Bravais lattice type. The remaining three letters refer to the point
group of the crystal.


<P>
Some modifications to the notation convention are made for use with a
keyboard. Spaces must separate each of the four symbols. Subscripted
numbers are printed next to the number being modified (e.g. 6_3 is
printed as <CODE>63</CODE>). A bar above a number is entered with a minus sign.


<P>
Occasionally there are variations in how space groups are
referenced. For example, the hausmannite structure of Mn3 O4 is placed
in space group <CODE>I 41/A M D</CODE> by the conventions laid out in
<I>The International Tables</I>. In <I>Crystal Structures</I> v. 3,
Wyckoff denotes this space group as <CODE>I 4/A M D</CODE>. This sort of
incongruity is unfortunate. The list of Hermann-Maguin space group
designations as recognized by ATOMS is included in appendix A.
If you cannot resolve the incongruity using this list, try using the
Schoenflies notation.


<P>
The Schoenflies conventions are also recognized by ATOMS. In the
literature there is less variation in the application of these
conventions. The Schoenflies convention is, in fact, less precise than
the Hermann-Maguin in that the complete symmetry characteristics of the
crystal are not encoded in the space group designation. Adaptations to
the keyboard have been made here as well. Subscripts are denoted with an
underscore (_) and superscripts are denoted with a caret (^). Spaces are
not allowed in the keyboard designation. A couple of examples:
<CODE>d_4^8</CODE>, and <CODE>O_5.</CODE> The underscore does not need to precede to
superscript. <CODE>C_2^V9</CODE> can also be written <CODE>C^V9_2</CODE>. Each of
the 230 space groups as designated by the Schoenflies notation is listed
in Appendix A in the same order as the listing of the Hermann-Maguin
notation. The two conventions are equally supported in the code.




<H2><A NAME="SEC14" HREF="atoms_toc.html#TOC14">Unique Crystallographic Positions</A></H2>

<P>
The atom or basis list in <CODE>atoms.inp</CODE> is a list of the
unique crystallographic sites in the unit cell. A unique site is one
(and only one) of a group of equivalent positions. The equivalent
positions are related to one another by the symmetry properties of the
crystal. ATOMS determines the symmetry properties of the
crystal from the name of the space group and applies those symmetry
operations to each unique site to generate all of the equivalent
positions.


<P>
If you include more than one of a group of equivalent positions in the
atom or basis list, then a few odd things will happen. A series of
run-time messages will be printed to the screen telling you that atom
positions were found that were coincident in space. This is because
each of the equivalent positions generated the same set of points in
the unit cell. ATOMS removes these redundancies from the
atom list. The atom list and the potentials list written to
<CODE>feff.inp</CODE> will be correct and FEFF can be run
correctly using this output. However, the site tags and the indexing
of the atoms will certainly make no sense. Also the density of the
crystal will be calculated incorrectly, thus the absorption
calculation (section 4.1) and the self-absorption correction (section
4.3) will be calculated incorrectly as well. The McMaster correction
(section 4.2) is unaffected.




<H2><A NAME="SEC15" HREF="atoms_toc.html#TOC15">Specially Recognized Lattice Types</A></H2>

<P>
For some common crystal types it is convenient to have a shorthand way
of designating the space group. For instance, one might remember that
copper is an fcc crystal, but not that it is in space group <CODE>F M 3
M</CODE> (or <CODE>O_H^5</CODE>). In this spirit, ATOMS will recognize the
following words for common crystal types. These words may be used as the
value of the keyword space and ATOMS will supply the correct space
group. Note that several of the common crystal types are in the same
space groups. For copper it will still be necessary to specify that an
atom lies at (0,0,0), but it isn't necessary to remember that the space
group is <CODE>F M 3 M</CODE>.

<H2><A NAME="SEC16" HREF="atoms_toc.html#TOC16">Bravais Lattice Conventions</A></H2>

<P>
ATOMS assumes certain conventions for each of the Bravais
lattice types. Listed here are the labeling conventions for the axes
and angles in each Bravais lattice.



<UL>
<LI>Triclinic:

All axes and angles must be specified.

<LI>Monoclinic:

<CODE>B</CODE> is the perpendicular axis, thus <CODE>beta</CODE> is the angle not
equal to 90.

<LI>Orthorhombic:

<CODE>A</CODE>, <CODE>B</CODE>, and <CODE>C</CODE> must all be specified.

<LI>Tetragonal:

The <CODE>C</CODE> axis is the unique axis in a tetragonal cell. The <CODE>A</CODE>
and <CODE>B</CODE> axes are equivalent. Specify <CODE>A</CODE> and <CODE>C</CODE> in
<CODE>atoms.inp</CODE>.

<LI>Trigonal:

If the cell is rhombohedral then the three axes are equivalent as are
the three angles. Specify <CODE>A</CODE> and <CODE>alpha</CODE>. If the cell has
hexagonal axes, specify <CODE>A</CODE> and <CODE>C</CODE>. <CODE>gamma</CODE> will be set to
120 by the program.

<LI>Hexagonal:

The equivalent axes are <CODE>A</CODE> and <CODE>B</CODE>. Specify <CODE>A</CODE> and <CODE>C</CODE>
in <CODE>atoms.inp</CODE>. <CODE>Gamma</CODE> will be set to 120 by the program.

<LI>Cubic:

Specify <CODE>A</CODE> in &#60;tt /atoms.inp/. The other axes will be set equal
to <CODE>A</CODE> and the angles will all be set to 90.

</UL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC17" HREF="atoms_toc.html#TOC17">Low Symmetry Space Groups</A></H2>

<P>
In three dimensional space there is an ambiguity in choice of right
handed coordinate systems. Given a set of mutually orthogonal axes,
there are six choices for how to label the positive <I>x</I>, <I>y</I>,
and <I>z</I> directions. For some specific physical problem, the
crystallographer might choose a non-standard setting for a crystal.
The choice of standard setting is described in detail in <I>The
International Tables</I>. The Hermann-Maguin symbol describes the
symmetries of the space group relative to this choice of coordinate
system.


<P>
The symbols for triclinic crystals and for crystals of high symmetry
are insensitive to choice of axes. Monoclinic and orthorhombic
notations reflect the choice of axes for those groups that possess a
unique axis. Tetragonal crystals may be rotated by 45 degrees about
the z axis to produce a unit cell of doubled volume and of a different
Bravais type. Alternative symbols for those space groups that have
them are listed in Appendix A.


<P>
ATOMS recognizes those non-standard notations for these crystal
classes that are tabulated in <I>The International Tables</I>.
<CODE>atoms.inp</CODE> may use any of these alternate notations so long as
the specified cell dimensions and atomic positions are consistent with
the choice of notation. Any notation not tabulated in chapter 6 of
the 1969 edition of <I>The International Tables</I> will not be
recognized by ATOMS.


<P>
This resolution of ambiguity in choice of coordinate system is one of
the main advantages of the Hermann-Maguin notation system over that
of Shoenflies. In a situation where a non-standard setting has been
chosen in the literature, use of the Schoenflies notation will, for
many space groups, result in unsatisfactory output from ATOMS.
In these situations, ATOMS requires the use of the
Hermann-Maguinn notation to resolve the choice of axes.


<P>
Here is an example. In the literature reference, La2 Cu O4 was given
in the non-standard <CODE>b m a b</CODE> setting rather than the standard
<CODE>c m c a</CODE>. As you can see from the axes and coordinates, these
settings differ by a 90 degree rotation about the <CODE>A</CODE> axis. The
coordination geometry of the output atom list will be the same with
either of these input files, but the actual coordinates will reflect
this 90 degree rotation.

<H2><A NAME="SEC18" HREF="atoms_toc.html#TOC18">Rhombohedral Space Groups</A></H2>

<P>
There are seven rhombohedral space groups. Crystals in any of these
space groups that may be represented as either monomolecular
rhombohedral cells or as trimolecular hexagonal cells. These two
representations are entirely equivalent. The rhombohedral space
groups are the ones beginning with the letter <CODE>R</CODE> in the
Hermann-Maguin notation. ATOMS does not care which representation
you use, but a simple convention must be maintained. If the
rhombohedral representation is used then the keyword <CODE>alpha</CODE> must
be specified in <CODE>atoms.inp</CODE> to designate the angle between the
rhombohedral axes and the keyword <CODE>a</CODE> must be specified to
designate the length of the rhombohedral axes. If the hexagonal
representation is used, then <CODE>a</CODE> and <CODE>c</CODE> must be specified in
<CODE>atoms.inp</CODE>. <CODE>Gamma</CODE> will be set to 120 by the code. Atomic
coordinates consistent with the choice of axes must be used.




<H2><A NAME="SEC19" HREF="atoms_toc.html#TOC19">Multiple Origins and the Shift Keyword</A></H2>

<P>
Some space groups in <I>The International Tables</I> are listed with two
possible origins. The difference is only in which symmetry point is
placed at (0,0,0). ATOMS always wants the orientation labeled
"origin-at-centre". This orientation places (0,0,0) at a point of
highest crystallographic symmetry. Wyckoff and other authors have the
unfortunate habit of not choosing the "origin-at-centre" orientation
when there is a choice. Again Mn3 O4 is an example. Wyckoff uses the
"origin at -4m2" option, which places one Mn atom at (0,0,0) and
another at (0,1/4,5/8). ATOMS wants the "origin-at-centre"
orientation which places these atoms at (0,3/4,1/8) and (0,0,1/2).
Admittedly, this is an arcane and frustrating limitation of the code,
but it is not possible to conclusively check if the
"origin-at-centre" orientation has been chosen.


<P>
Twenty one of the space groups are listed with two origins in <I>The
International Tables for X-Ray Crystallography</I>. ATOMS knows
which groups these are and by how much the two origins are offset, but
<B>cannot</B> know if you chose the correct one for your crystal. If
you use one of these groups, ATOMS will print a run-time message
warning you of the potential problem and telling you by how much to
shift the atomic coordinates in <CODE>atoms.inp</CODE> if the incorrect
orientation was used. This warning will also be printed at the top of
the <CODE>feff.inp</CODE> file. If you use the "origin-at-center"
orientation, you may ignore this message.


<P>
If you use one of these space groups, it usually isn't hard to know if
you have used the incorrect orientation. Some common problems include
atoms in the atom list that are very close together (less that 1
angstrom), unphysically large densities (see section 4.1), and
interatomic distances that do not agree with values published in the
crystallography literature. Because it is tedious to edit the atomic
coordinates in the input file every time this problem is encountered
and because forcing the user to do arithmetic (any good scientist's
bugaboo!) invites trouble, there is a useful keyword called <CODE>shift</CODE>.
For the Mn3 O4 example discussed above, simply insert this line in
<CODE>atoms.inp</CODE> if you have supplied coordinates referenced to
the incorrect origin:

<PRE>
  shift = 0.0  0.25 -0.125
</PRE>

<P>
This vector will be added to all of the coordinates in the atom list
after the input file is read.


<P>
Here is the input file for Mn3 O4 using the shift keyword:

<H1><A NAME="SEC20" HREF="atoms_toc.html#TOC20">Absorption Calculation and Experimental Corrections</A></H1>

<P>
Included in ATOMS is data from <I>Compilation of X-Ray Cross
Sections</I> by McMaster, et al. Using this and the crystallographic
information from <CODE>atoms.inp</CODE>, ATOMS is able to make several
calculations useful for XAFS analysis. It approximates the absorption
depth and edge step size of the material at the edge energy of the
core atom and estimates three corrections needed for the analysis of
XAFS data. These corrections are the "McMaster correction", the
energy response of the I0 chamber in a fluorescence experiment, and
the self-absorption of a thick material in a fluorescence experiment.
All of these numbers are written at the top of the output file. For
more information on these calculations consult Chapter 10 of
<I>Handbook of Synchrotron Radiation, v.1.</I>




<H2><A NAME="SEC21" HREF="atoms_toc.html#TOC21">Absorption Calculation</A></H2>

<P>
Proper sample preparation for an XAFS experiment requires knowledge of
the absorption depth and edge step size of the material of interest.
The statistics of data collection can be optimized by choosing the
correct sample thickness. It is also necessary to avoid distortions
to the data due to thickness and large particle size effects.


<P>
ATOMS calculates the total cross section of the material above
the edge energy of the central atom and divides by the unit cell
volume. The number obtained, <I>mu&#38;lowbar;total</I>, has units of
cm&#38;circ;-1. Thus, if x is the thickness of the sample in cm, the
x-ray beam passing through the sample will be attenuated by
<EM>exp(-mu_total * x)</EM>.


<P>
ATOMS also calculates the change in cross section of the central
atom below and above the absorption edge and divides by the unit cell
volume. This number, delta_mu, multiplied by the sample thickness in cm
gives the approximate edge step in a transmission experiment.


<P>
The density of the material is also reported. This number assumes that
the bulk material will have the same density as the unit cell. It is
included as an aid to sample preparation.




<H2><A NAME="SEC22" HREF="atoms_toc.html#TOC22">McMaster Correction</A></H2>

<P>
Typically, XAFS data is normalized to a single number representing the
size of the edge step. While there are compelling reasons to use this
simple normalization, it can introduce an important distortion to the
amplitude of the chi(k) extracted from the absorption data. This
distortion comes from energy response of the bare atom absorption of
the central atom. This is poorly approximated away from the edge by a
single number. Because this affects the amplitude of chi(k)
and not the phase, it can be corrected by including a Debye-Waller
factor and a fourth cumulant in the analysis of the data. These two
"McMaster corrections" are intended to be additive corrections to any
thermal or structural disorder included in the analysis of the XAFS.


<P>
ATOMS uses data from McMaster to construct the bare atom absorption
for the central atom. ATOMS then regresses a quadratic polynomial
in energy to the natural logarithm of the constructed central atom
absorption. Because energy and photo-electron wave number are simply
related, E is proportional to k^2, the coefficients of this regression
can be related to the XAFS Debye-Waller factor and fourth cumulant. The
coefficient of the term linear in energy equals <EM>2*sigma_MM^2</EM> and
the coefficient of the quadratic term equals <EM>4/3 *
sigma_MM^4</EM>. The values of <I>sigma_MM^2</I> and <I>sigma_MM^2</I> are written
at the top of the output file.




<H2><A NAME="SEC23" HREF="atoms_toc.html#TOC23">I0 Correction.</A></H2>

<P>
The response of the I0 chamber varies with energy during an XAFS
experiment. In a fluorescence experiment, the absorption signal is
obtained by normalizing the IF signal by the I0 signal. There is no
energy response in the IF signal since all atoms fluoresce at set
energies. The energy response of I0 is ignored by this normalization.
At low energies this can be a significant effect. Like the McMaster
correction, this effect attenuates the amplitude of chi(k) and is is
well approximated by an additional Debye-Waller factor and fourth
cumulant.


<P>
ATOMS uses the values of the nitrogen, argon and krypton keywords
in <CODE>atoms.inp</CODE> to determine the content of the I0 chamber by
pressure. It assumes that the remainder of the chamber is filled with
helium. It then uses McMaster's data to construct the energy response
of the chamber and regresses a polynomial to it in the manner
described above. <I>sigma_I0^2</I> and
<I>sigma_I0^4</I> are also written at the top of the output
file and intended as additive corrections in the analysis.




<H2><A NAME="SEC24" HREF="atoms_toc.html#TOC24">Self-Absorption Correction.</A></H2>

<P>
If the thickness of a sample is large compared to absorption length of
the sample and the absorbing atom is sufficiently concentrated in the
sample, then the amplitude of the chi(k) extracted from the data taken
on it in fluorescence will be distorted by self-absorption effects in
a way that is easily estimated. The absorption depth of the material
might vary significantly through the absorption edge and the XAFS
wiggles. The correction for this effect is well approximated as

<PRE>
   1 + mu_abs / (mu_background+mu_fluor)
</PRE>

<P>
where <I>mu_background</I> is the absorption of the non-resonant
atoms in the material and <I>mu_fluor</I> is the total absorption
of the material at the fluorescent energy of the absorbing atom.
ATOMS constructs this function using the McMaster tables then
regresses a polynomial to it in the manner described above.
<I>sigma_self^2</I> and <I>sigma_self^4</I> are
written at the top of the output file and intended as additive
corrections in the analysis. Because the size of the edge step is
affected by self-absorption, the amplitude of chi(k) is attenuated
when normalized to the edge step. Since the amplitude is a measure of
<I>S0^2</I>, this is an important effect. The number reported in
<CODE>feff.inp</CODE> as the amplitude factor is intended to be a
multiplicative correction to the data or to the measured
<I>S0^2</I>.




<H1><A NAME="SEC25" HREF="atoms_toc.html#TOC25">A Worked Example</A></H1>

<P>
Here is an example of ATOMS in action. The material is Lead
Titanate, PbTiO3. The crystallographic literature places this material
in the tetragonal space group <CODE>P 4 M M</CODE>. The data was taken in
fluorescence at the titanium K-edge. Since the edge energy is around
5 KeV and the sample was very thick, the I0 and self-absorption
corrections are expected to be significant. That titanium is the
central atom is indicated by the keyword <CODE>core</CODE>. ATOMS
assumes the K-edge of the titanium was probed because the atomic
number of titanium is less than 57 and the edge was not otherwise
chosen with the <CODE>edge</CODE> keyword. The I0 chamber was filled with
92% helium and 8% nitrogen by pressure. This is
indicated by the <CODE>nitrogen</CODE> keyword. The indexing feature is
engaged with the <CODE>index</CODE> keyword. The size of the cluster to be
printed in <CODE>feff.inp</CODE> is chosen with the <CODE>rmax</CODE> keyword.

ATOMS produces the output reproduced below. The absorption and

<CODE>CONTROL</CODE> cards are set to 1 and the <CODE>PRINT</CODE> cards are set to 0.
This will run all four modules of FEFF and produce the default
output files. Several other useful FEFF cards are printed but
commented out by an asterisk (<CODE>*</CODE>). The unique potential list is
constructed in a simple fashion -- the core atom is potential 0 and
each different atomic species has a single potential. The atom list
is printed in the format required by FEFF. The atom list has two
comment columns. The indexed atomic symbol and radial distance are
written by ATOMS for your use when reading <CODE>feff.inp</CODE> and are
ignored by FEFF.


<P>
FEFF will run to completion using the input file generated by
ATOMS. It is still likely that the user will want to edit
<CODE>feff.inp</CODE>. Several assumptions are made by ATOMS
that might not hold true. The assignment of unique potentials is made
by a simple algorithm and may not adequately reflect the physics of
the problem. The <CODE>CONTROL</CODE> cards are such that all four modules of
FEFF will be run. The FEFF user might want to run
the modules separately. Values for other cards have been assumed and
might not be desired. Other cards have been left out entirely.
Always check your <CODE>feff.inp</CODE> file to be sure it is just

<H2><A NAME="SEC27" HREF="atoms_toc.html#TOC27">Acknowledgments</A></H2>

<P>
I would like to thank my many colleagues who have been a source of
help and inspiration. The support of Profs. Ed Stern and John Rehr
has always been appreciated. I would like to thank Chuck Bouldin,
Boyan Boyanovich, Julie Cross, Tim Elam, Matt Newville, Hans Stragier,
Kalle Voss, Steve Zabinsky, and Yanjun Zhang for their contributions,
helpful criticism and useful suggestions as I have developed this
program.


<P>
The essential calculation in this program is handled in the routine
<CODE>equipt</CODE>, which decodes the Hermann-Maguin notation and performs
the proscribed symmetry operations on the input atomic coordinates.
This routine was written by H. Burzlaff and A. Hountas and is in the
public domain. Several parts of this program were inspired by the
program SEXIE by Bernhard Rupp. SEXIE uses input files that
are similar to <CODE>atoms.inp</CODE> and its database is a good resource for
composing <CODE>atoms.inp</CODE> files. The original version of the routine
<CODE>mucal</CODE> was written by P. Bandyopadhyay using data from
<I>Compilation of X-Ray Cross Section</I> by McMaster et. al. Several
of the character string manipulation routines (<CODE>triml, istrln,
upper, lower, bwords</CODE>) were written by S.I. Zabinsky and M. Newville
and released for this use.




<H2><A NAME="SEC28" HREF="atoms_toc.html#TOC28">Comments on the Fortran Code</A></H2>

<P>
Every routine used by ATOMS has been written in ANSI standard
Fortran-77. At the time of this writing the code has been found to
compile and run under many difffernt operating systems. Presently,
the code is developed on an Intel 486 laptop which runs Linux using
F2C and GCC for compilation. The code is thus easily ported to any
machine with a Fortran compiler. The author has run ATOMS under
four different unixes, MS-DOS, Macintosh System 7.5, Vax-VMS, and
Open-VMS on an DEC Alpha. At this time, there are four caveats for
the user:



<OL>
<LI>

In the main program, the unit for the output files are opened
with status <CODE>unknown</CODE>. On VMS machines, it is more convenient, but
not necessary, to open files with <CODE>new</CODE> status to take advantage of
multiple versions of files. To change this for use on a Vax-VMS
machine, search for the line in the main program where the variable
<CODE>vaxflg</CODE> is defined and change it to <CODE>.true.</CODE>

<LI>

All run-time messages are written by the subroutine
<CODE>messag</CODE>. Thus if your machine has particular requirements for
writing to standard output, <CODE>messag</CODE> should be the only routine
that you need to alter.

<LI>

Tab characters are allowed in the input file, even though the
handling of tab characters might be machine specific. This is done by
reading a line from the input file and filtering it through a
subroutine called <CODE>untab</CODE>, which replaces tab characters with blank
spaces. <CODE>untab</CODE> is written assuming tab is ASCII character 9. If
your machine handles this differently, you only need to edit
<CODE>untab</CODE> or simply don't use tabs.

<LI>

The character string manipulation assumes the ASCII character
set. If your machine does not use ASCII, then you are probably
familiar with how to alter code for use on your machine. Contact the
author for which subroutines need to be altered.
</OL>

<P>
If you ever have a problem with carriage-control while using
ATOMS or FEFF with a <CODE>feff.inp</CODE> file generated by
ATOMS, please contact the author.


<P>
ATOMS is delivered with the following parameter values:

<OL>
<LI>

 <CODE>iat = 20</CODE>, maximum number of unique atoms
<LI>

 <CODE>natx = 800</CODE>, maximum number of atoms in cluster
<LI>

 <CODE>ntitx = 9</CODE>, maximum number of title lines
<LI>

 <CODE>maxln = 800</CODE>, maximum number of atoms in <CODE>feff.inp</CODE>
</OL>

<P>
FEFF limits the size of the cluster in its calculation to 400
atoms. In ATOMS these values are imposed by parameter
statements, thus are easy to change. Global parameters such as these
are set in the main program and passed as arguments to the rest of the
program. Find these near the beginning of the main program and change
them to whatever value you want. If you do not know exactly how to do
this but still think you need to, consult your local Fortran guru or,
if you must, the author.


<P>
The source code for ATOMS is written in a style with mostly lower
case characters. All executable statements are written in lower case.
This is a departure from strict adherence to the ANSI standard.
Care has been taken to make the code insensitive to case. That is, the
source may be placed in all upper case or all lower case without
damaging its functionality. The algorithm that parses the input file
is certainly insensitive to case.




<H2><A NAME="SEC29" HREF="atoms_toc.html#TOC29">What is new since version 2.42</A></H2>


<OL>
<LI>

 Correct handling of hexagonal space groups. This is the
most important new feature. My chagrined thanks to the <B>many</B>
people who discovered this little problem and took the time to tell me
about it. I also improved handling of trigonal and rhombohedral space
groups.

<LI>

 Support for notations of all settings of orthorhombic,
tetragonal, and monoclinic space groups. &#60;sl/atoms/ is now fully
compliant with all Hermann-Maguin short notations as specified in
&#60;it/The International Tables of X-Ray Crystallography/, 1969 edition.

<LI>

 Better recognition of Schoenflies notation.

<LI>

 Improved error messages. Hopefully my error messages are now
more informative and spelled correctly.

<LI>

 Improvements to the calculations using the McMaster tables. I
have also corrected a few incorrect values that have been found in the
electronic version of the McMaster tables.

<LI>

 Addition of <CODE>p1</CODE> and <CODE>krypton</CODE> keywords.

<LI>

 Improved writing of <CODE>geom.dat</CODE> files.

<LI>

 Improved handling of input and output filenames.

<LI>

 Allow L1 and L2 edges for <CODE>feff.inp</CODE>.

<LI>

 Writing of five digits after the decimal places in <CODE>feff.inp</CODE>.
This matches the precision of &#60;sl/feff/'s degeneracy checker.

<LI>

 Writing of edge energy in the <CODE>HOLE</CODE> line of <CODE>feff.inp</CODE>.
This is for informational purposes only, it serves no purpose in
&#60;sl/feff/.
</OL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC30" HREF="atoms_toc.html#TOC30">Naming Conventions</A></H2>

<P>
Between versions 2.41 and 2.42, my program had a name change. Earlier
versions were called ATOM, while later versions are called
ATOMS, with an S. The reason for this change was to avoid
confusion with the subroutine <CODE>atom</CODE> that is an important part of
FEFF. Hopefully this reduces confusion rather than adds to it!
For now, the version number is incremented by 0.01 when minor
functionality is added and by 0.1 when major functionality is added.
Bug corrections have been denoted with an incrementing letter appended
to the version number.

<H1><A NAME="SEC33" HREF="atoms_toc.html#TOC33">Denoting Space Groups</A></H1>

<P>
This appendix is my attempt to demystify the crazy symbolism used by
the Hermann-Maguin and Schoenflies conventions. This is by no means
an adequate explanation of the rich and beautiful field of
crystallography. For that, I recommend one of the books in the
bibliography.


<P>
An important part of the demystification process is to define some of
the important terms used to describe crystal symmetries. The words
<I>system</I>, <I>Bravais lattice</I>, <I>crystal class</I>, and <I>space
group</I> have well-defined meanings. The symbols used in each of the
notation conventions specifically relate the various symmetries of
crystals. In crystallography, a symmetry operation is defined as a
sequence of reflections, translations, and/or rotations that map the
crystal back onto itself in such a way that the crystal after the
mapping is indistinguishable from the crystal before the mapping.




<H2><A NAME="SEC34" HREF="atoms_toc.html#TOC34">A Quick Review of Crystallography</A></H2>

<P>
To start, here are some definitions. These will be elaborated below.



<UL>
<LI>System:

The undecorated shape of the unit cell.
<LI>Bravais Lattice:

An undecorated lattice of equivalent points.
<LI>Crystal Class:

The description of the symmetries about a point.
<LI>Space Group:

The complete description of three dimensional
crystal symmetries.
</UL>

<P>
There are seven systems of crystals. The system refers to the shape
of the undecorated unit cell. They are:



<UL>
<LI>Triclinic:

a != b != c, alpha != beta != gamma != 90 deg

<LI>Monoclinic:

a != b != c, alpha=gamma=90 deg, beta != 90 deg
<LI>Orthorhombic:

a != b != c, alpha=beta=gamma=90 deg
<LI>Tetragonal:

a = b != c, alpha=beta=gamma=90 deg
<LI>Hexagonal:

a = b != c, alpha=beta=90 deg, gamma=120 deg
<LI>Trigonal:

(rhombohedral axes):<BR>
a = b = c, alpha=beta=gamma &#60; 120 deg != 90 deg
(hexagonal axes):<BR>
a = b != c, alpha=beta=90 deg, gamma=120 deg
<LI>cubic:

a = b = c, alpha=beta=gamma=90 deg
</UL>

<P>
There are fourteen Bravais lattices. The Bravais lattices are
constructed from the simplest translational symmetries applied to the
seven crystal systems. A <CODE>P</CODE> lattice has decoration only at the
corners of the unit cell. An <CODE>I</CODE> lattice has decoration at the
body center of the cell as well as at the corners. An <CODE>F</CODE> lattice
has decoration at the face centers as well as at the corners. A
<CODE>C</CODE> lattice has decoration at the center of the (001) face as well
as at the corners. Likewise <CODE>A</CODE> and <CODE>B</CODE> lattices have
decoration at the centers of the (100) and (010) faces respectively.
<CODE>R</CODE> lattices are a special type in the trigonal system which
possess rhombohedral symmetry.


<P>
All seven crystal systems have <CODE>P</CODE> lattices, but not all the
classes have the other type of Bravais lattices. This is because
there is degeneracy when all the Bravais lattice types are applied to
all the crystal systems. For example, a face centered tetragonal cell
can be expressed as a body centered tetragonal cell by rotating the
two equivalent axes by 45 deg and shortening them by a factor of
square root of 2. Considering such degeneracies reduces the possible
decorations of the seven systems to these 14 unique three dimensional
lattices:



<PRE>
  Triclinic     P
  Monoclinic    P, C
  Orthorhombic  P, C, I, F
  Tetragonal    P, I
  Hexagonal     P
  Trigonal      P, R
  Cubic         P, I, F
</PRE>

<P>
For historic reasons, hexagonal cells are sometimes called <CODE>C</CODE>
lattices. ATOMS will recognize hexagonal <CODE>P</CODE> cells denoted in
<CODE>atoms.inp</CODE> by the letter <CODE>C</CODE>. Modern literature usually uses
the <CODE>P</CODE> designation.


<P>
The decorations placed on the Bravais lattices come in 32 flavors
called classes or point groups which represent the possible symmetries
within the decorations. Each type of symmetry is defined either by a
reflection plane, a rotation axis, or a rotary inversion axis. A
reflection plane can either be a simple mirror plane or a glide plane,
which defines the symmetry operation of reflecting through a mirror
followed by translating along a direction in the plane. A rotation
axis can either define a simple rotation or a screw rotation, which is
the symmetry operation of rotating about the axis followed by
translating along that axis. A rotary inversion axis defines the
symmetry operation of reflecting through a plane followed by rotating
about an axis in that plane.


<P>
These three symmetry types, reflection plane, rotation axis, and
rotary inversion axis, can be combined in 32 non-degenerate ways. (An
example degeneracy: the symmetry operation of combining a 180 deg
rotary inversion with a mirror reflection is identical to the
operation of a simple 180 deg rotation.) It would seem that the 32
classes could decorate the 14 Bravais lattices in 458 ways. In fact,
the number might be larger as there are numerous types of screw axes
and glide planes. Again, considering degeneracies reduces the total
number of combinations, leaving 230 unique decorations of the Bravais
lattices. These are called space groups. The 230 space groups are a
rigorously complete set of descriptions of crystal symmetries in three
dimensional space. That is, there may be new crystals but there are
no new space groups. Here I am only considering space-filling
crystals with translational periodicity. 3-D Penrose structures and
quasi-crystals are outside the realm of this appendix and of the code.




<H2><A NAME="SEC35" HREF="atoms_toc.html#TOC35">Decoding the Hermann-Maguin Notation</A></H2>

<P>
The Hermann-Maguin notation uses a set of two to four symbols to
completely specify the symmetries of a space group. The first symbol
is always a single letter specifying the Bravais lattice. The next
three symbols specify the class of the space group. These three
symbols are some combination of the following characters:

<PRE>
    1 2 3 4 5 6 A B C D M N / -
</PRE>

<P>
These are sufficient to completely specify the various planar and
axial symmetries of the classes and sub-classes. The following is a
discussion of the most important rules of this convention. Some
details are neglected but sufficient information is provided to
appreciate the information contained in the notation.


<P>
The second symbol in the Hermann-Maguin notation, i.e. the one after
the Bravais lattice symbol, tells about symmetries involving the
primary axis of the cell and/or of the plane normal to the primary
axis. The primary axis is defined as follows:



<UL>
<LI>Triclinic:

none
<LI>Monoclinic:

the B axis
<LI>Orthorhombic:

the C axis
<LI>Tetragonal:

the C axis
<LI>Hexagonal:

the C axis
<LI>Trigonal:

the A axis
<LI>Cubic:

the A axis
</UL>

<P>
In cubic or rhombohedral lattices the axes are equivalent, thus the
primary axis is arbitrary. For orthorhombic lattices the third and
fourth symbols specify the symmetries of the a and b axes
respectively. In other lattices, the last two symbols encode the
remaining symmetries as described below.


<P>
A space filling crystal will always show a symmetry when rotated
through <EM>(360/n)</EM> degrees, where n is one of {1,2,3,4, or 6}.
The second symbol often tells the rotational symmetry properties of
the primary axis. Notice that all trigonal, tetragonal, and hexagonal
groups have a <CODE>3</CODE>, <CODE>4</CODE>, or <CODE>6</CODE> respectively in their
designations. Many orthorhombic and monoclinic groups have a <CODE>2</CODE>,
which is the highest degree of rotational symmetry available to those
lattices. Cubic groups may possess 2- or 4-fold rotational symmetry
about the cell axes, thus have <CODE>2</CODE> or <CODE>4</CODE> in the second symbol.


<P>
Many second symbols contain a second number. This is the subscripted
number when the Hermann-Maguin notation is typeset. This refers to the
type of screw symmetry associated with the axis. A screw symmetric
lattice is mapped onto itself by an anti-clockwise rotation through
<EM>m * (360/n)</EM> degrees and a translation of <EM>1/n</EM> up the
primary axis. Here n is the degree of rotational symmetry, m is the type
of screw, and the definition of rotation and direction is
right-handed. Two types of screw symmetry that are different only in
handedness of rotation are called enantiomorphous. The enantiomorphous
pairs are <CODE>31</CODE> and <CODE>32</CODE>, <CODE>41</CODE> and <CODE>43</CODE>, <CODE>61</CODE>
and <CODE>65</CODE>, and <CODE>62</CODE> and <CODE>64</CODE>.


<P>
Several of the second symbols are one or two numbers followed by a
slash and a letter, e.g. <CODE>P 63/M M C</CODE>. The letter specifies
the type of reflection plane that is normal to the rotation axis.


<P>
There are several types of reflection planes. The simplest is a
mirror plane, denoted by the letter <CODE>M</CODE>. This says the crystal is
mapped onto itself by reflecting all atoms through a mirror placed in
an appropriate plane in the crystal. The letters <CODE>A</CODE>, <CODE>B</CODE>, or
<CODE>C</CODE> denote glide planes. These map the crystal onto itself by
reflecting through the plane then translating elements of the crystal
by half the length of the cell axis normal to the reflection plane. A
<CODE>D</CODE> glide plane is similar but involves translations of a quarter of the
cell axis length. Finally, the letter <CODE>N</CODE> denotes a diagonal glide
plane, which is a reflection through a plane followed by a translation
in the same plane of half the length of both cell axes in that plane.


<P>
The symbol <CODE>-</CODE> before a number indicates a rotary inversion axis.
This maps the crystal back onto itself by rotating through
<EM>(360/n)</EM> deg then reflecting through a plane parallel to the
rotation axis.


<P>
A final word about the Hermann-Maguin notation. All cubic space groups
have four three-fold rotational axes through the body diagonals. Thus
all cubic groups have the number 3 as the third symbol.




<H2><A NAME="SEC36" HREF="atoms_toc.html#TOC36">Decoding the Schoenflies Notation</A></H2>

<P>
The Schoenflies notation uses a set of three symbols to classify sets
of space groups by their dominant symmetry features. The letters
<CODE>C</CODE>, <CODE>D</CODE>, <CODE>S</CODE>, <CODE>T</CODE>, and <CODE>O</CODE> denote the character of the
center of symmetry. The symbol after the underscore (the subscript
when typeset) indicates the presence of symmetry planes and additional
symmetry axes. The number after the caret (the superscript when
typeset) is simply an indexing of all the distinct space groups that
share major symmetry properties. In the older literature, <CODE>D</CODE>
symmetry centers are occasionally referred to as <CODE>V</CODE>. ATOMS
will probably understand a space group referred to by the letter
<CODE>V</CODE>, but using the <CODE>D</CODE> notation is recommended.


<P>
The letter <CODE>C</CODE> indicates an rotation axis where the crystal is
mapped onto itself when rotated by (360/n) deg, where n is the number
after the underscore. An H after the underscore indicates the presence
of a plane of symmetry normal to the rotation axis. A <CODE>V</CODE> after the
underscore indicates one or two planes of symmetry parallel to the
rotation axis. The letter <CODE>S</CODE> after the underscore indicates a
normal plane of symmetry in a crystal where the degree of rotational
symmetry is 1. The letter <CODE>I</CODE> after the underscore indicates the
presence of a point center of symmetry.


<P>
The letter <CODE>S</CODE> indicates a rotary inversion axis. The degree of
rotation is the number after the underscore.


<P>
The letter <CODE>D</CODE> denotes a primary rotation axis with another
rotation axis normal to it. The degree of rotation of both axes is the
number after the underscore. The letters <CODE>H</CODE> and <CODE>V</CODE> have the
same meanings as they did in groups beginning with the letter
<CODE>C</CODE>. The letter <CODE>D</CODE> indicates the presence of a diagonal
symmetry plane.


<P>
Cubic groups are all specified by the letters <CODE>T</CODE> and <CODE>O</CODE>.
<CODE>T</CODE> indicates tetrahedral symmetry, that is, the presence of the
four three-fold axes and three two-fold axes. <CODE>O</CODE> indicates
octahedral symmetry, i.e. four three-fold axes with three four-fold
axes. <CODE>H</CODE> and <CODE>D</CODE> after the underscore carry the same meaning
as before.

<H3><A NAME="SEC39" HREF="atoms_toc.html#TOC39">Nonstandard Notations</A></H3>

<P>
Here are the notations for the alternate settings of the monoclinic
and orthorhombic space groups. Also presented are the notations for
tetragonal space groups that have been rotated by 45 degrees resulting
in a unit cell of doubled volume and of a different Bravais type.


<P>
In an monoclinic or orthorhombic space group, the Hermann-Maguin
symbols are identical for the various settings if none of the three
axes possess special symmetry properties. In this case the three axes
are distinguished only by length and the symbol is the same for all
settings.


<P>
The column headings below indicate the orientations of the alternative
settings relative to the standard setting. For instance, <CODE>cab</CODE> is
a setting with axes and coordinates cyclically permuted from the
standard setting. This is equivalent to a rotation of 120 degrees
about an axis in a &#60;111&#62; direction relative to the Cartesian
axes. The setting <CODE>a-cb</CODE> is rotated by 90 degrees about the A
axis. Thus the <CODE>B</CODE> and <CODE>C</CODE> axes are swapped and the <CODE>y</CODE> and
<CODE>z</CODE> coordinates in the standard setting map onto the <CODE>z</CODE> and
<CODE>-y</CODE> coordinates of the alternate setting. In ATOMS, when an
alternative setting is specified in <CODE>atoms.inp</CODE>, the axes and
coordinates are multiplied by the appropriate permutation matrix onto
the standard setting. The positions in the unit cell are expanded
according to the Hermann-Maguin symbol for the standard setting. The
contents of the unit cell are then permuted back to the specified
setting.

<P>
The next several pages have numerous examples of <CODE>atoms.inp</CODE> files
that produce the correct output. In these examples you might find a
material of interest or its isomorph and you will certainly get clues
for making ATOMS work the way you want. By far the most useful
resource for the crystallographic data needed for these input files is
the <I>Crystal Structures</I> series by R.W.G. Wyckoff.

Here are several examples of <CODE>atoms.inp</CODE> files for various
High Tc superconductors. The crystallographic literature on this
class of materials is quite large and there are significant structural
differences even between similar materials. Two recommended resources
for crystal information are <I>Copper Oxide Superconductors</I>
by Poole, Datta, and Farach, Wiley-Interscience, New York (1988) and
<I>Physical Properties of High Temperature Superconductors
II</I>, ed. by Ginsberg, World Scientific (1990).
