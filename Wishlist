This is a wishlist for the next major version of Atoms.

--  All space groups mentioned in 1989 edition of ITXC.

{ from matt
--  bigger iat

--  accept # as a comment character 

--  allow an end card (what does "----" do?) 

--  change the default rmax to max(2*rnn,6).

--  xyz and other visualization formats, this requires a much larger
    cluster

--  consider a bounding box
             xbox  xmin xmax
             ybox  ymin ymax
             zbox  zmin zmax
             shift x y z  put central atom at xyz rather than 000

--  think about fractional occupation.  hmmmm....

--  coordinates outside of -1:1
}

--  cut plane for surfaces (e.g. Tarnjit Johal's question about 110
    plane of GaAs with S adsorbed

--  my own pathfinder

--  posibility: delimit "fields" information with {}

--  override lengths and angles for *all* space groups

--  write out symmetry tables

{ from Boyan
-- make shift message more intelligent

-- write out symmetry tables for the equivalent points

-- understand ratios of small fractions in the I/O structure
}

{ first pointed out by Fredrik Bikman, Dept of Organic Chemistry, 
  Uppsala University
  P.O. Box 531, S-751 21 Uppsala, Sweden

-- alternate origins in space groups 85, 86, 88, 125, 130, 133, 134,
   137, 138, 141, 142
}

{ from Julie
-- hkl == dafs == qvect
}

dafs documentation, including the Chuck feature of selctively turning
off anomalous part

error checking dafs input

tables of low energy absorption edges

{ From: Zachary Levine <zachary@molphys.nist.gov>

-- In that spirit, could we not use the tables at 
   http://www-cxro.lbl.gov/optical_constants/atten2.html to perform
   the same function, i.e., to normalize mu_0, which in turn normalizes mu?
}


Allow setting of variables and very simple math exrpressions, such as 
1/2 and 0.5+delta

{ From: Joerg Rockenberger <rocken@chemie.uni-hamburg.de>

-- It might be useful if ATOMS could generate an error message which says that
   the maximum number of atoms is exceeded.
}

{ from Chuck, this breaks it (another place of precision fixes it)

title = GaN
a = 3.180	c = 5.166	gamma = 120
core = Ga	rmax = 7	space = P 63 M C

    Ga	 0.333	 0.666	 0.0
    N 	 0.333	 0.666	 0.375
